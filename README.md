Jeswanth Adari — Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains my professional analytics portfolio, showcasing real-world work across data analytics, reporting, and decision support. The focus is on clarity, impact, and reliability — not dashboards for show, but analytics that drive action.

What I Do

I help teams turn messy, fragmented data into clear, decision-ready insights by:
	•	Designing KPI frameworks and performance metrics
	•	Building reliable reporting pipelines and dashboards
	•	Improving data quality, consistency, and trust
	•	Supporting leadership with actionable insights

My work sits at the intersection of analytics, operations, and business strategy.

Approach

I approach analytics with a simple principle:

If stakeholders can’t trust or act on the data, it isn’t useful.

My goal is to reduce ambiguity, support faster decisions, and build systems that scale.
